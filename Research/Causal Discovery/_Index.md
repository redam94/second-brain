# Causal Discovery

> [!abstract] Routing Summary
> This folder covers **causal structure learning / discovery** — learning the structure of
> directed acyclic graphs (DAGs / Bayesian networks) from data. Currently centered on **NOTEARS**
> (Zheng et al., 2018), which recasts DAG learning as continuous optimization. 5 concept notes + 1 paper.
> - Want the paper in one page? → [[NOTEARS - Overview]]
> - Need the problem setup (SEM, score functions, NP-hardness)? → [[DAG Structure Learning Problem]]
> - Need **the key theorem** ($h(W)=\mathrm{tr}\,e^{W\circ W}-d$, acyclicity)? → [[Smooth Characterization of Acyclicity]]
> - Need the optimization (augmented Lagrangian, L-BFGS, thresholding, Algorithm 1)? → [[NOTEARS Algorithm]]
> - Need empirical results (vs FGS, SHD/FDR, Sachs data)? → [[NOTEARS Experiments]]

## Concept Map

| Concept | Note | Type | Depends On | Key Result |
|---------|------|------|-----------|------------|
| Continuous reformulation of DAG learning | [[NOTEARS - Overview]] | overview | [[DAG Structure Learning Problem]] | Combinatorial → continuous program |
| Linear SEM + LS score | [[DAG Structure Learning Problem]] | concept | [[Confirmatory Factor Analysis and SEM]] | $F(W)=\frac{1}{2n}\lVert X-XW\rVert_F^2+\lambda\lVert W\rVert_1$ |
| Matrix-exponential acyclicity | [[Smooth Characterization of Acyclicity]] | theorem | [[DAG Structure Learning Problem]] | $h(W)=\mathrm{tr}\,e^{W\circ W}-d=0 \iff$ DAG |
| Acyclicity gradient | [[Smooth Characterization of Acyclicity]] | theorem | — | $\nabla h(W)=(e^{W\circ W})^T\circ 2W$ |
| Augmented-Lagrangian ECP | [[NOTEARS Algorithm]] | concept | [[Smooth Characterization of Acyclicity]] | $\min_W F(W)$ s.t. $h(W)=0$; <10 dual steps |
| Hard thresholding | [[NOTEARS Algorithm]] | concept | [[Smooth Characterization of Acyclicity]] | Round $|w|<\omega$ to 0 |
| Structure-recovery benchmarks | [[NOTEARS Experiments]] | example | [[NOTEARS Algorithm]] | Beats FGS on dense/large graphs; ≈ global optimum |

## Cross-Cutting Concepts
- **Linear SEM / weighted adjacency matrix $W$**: the object of estimation; appears in [[DAG Structure Learning Problem]] (definition) and threads through every note.
- **Matrix exponential $e^{W\circ W}$**: the engine of both the constraint ([[Smooth Characterization of Acyclicity]]) and its $O(d^3)$ cost ([[NOTEARS Algorithm]], [[NOTEARS Experiments]]).
- **Nonconvexity / stationary points**: introduced in [[Smooth Characterization of Acyclicity]], handled in [[NOTEARS Algorithm]], empirically assessed in [[NOTEARS Experiments]].
